	<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

	<strong>Why do dietitians need to estimate anthropometric measurement?</strong>
	<ul>
	  <li>Many patients are unable to walk (cerebral palsy, stroke, etc.) and / or are unable to roam beyond certain distance scale or stadiometer due to health problems. </li>
	  <li>The equipment for measuring weight and height are generally far from the beds;</li>
	  <li>After measuring the height and weight of patients, the dietitians can calculate the nutrient needs and prescribe the most suitable diet for the patients;</li>
	  <li>In most public hospitals in Brazil are not well equipped with computers. The dietitians are lacking appropriate software in nutrition services due to high cost and require professionals to perform the calculations by hand;</li>
	</ul>

	<strong>Why do dietitians need to assessment the anthropometric measurement?</strong>
	<ul>
	  <li>The dietitian need to make numerous calculations to prescribe
the diet of patients (the estimate measures of height and weight 
this is just one example) and to assessment anthropometric 
measurements. The spare time that is spent for calculations and 
approach the dietitian direct care of the patient;</li>
	  <li>The time spent to perform the calculations can harm the
prescription diet, if this step is omitted or there is error during 
calculation done by hand, as well as not performing the 
calculations result in a standard prescription, which can not meet 
the needs patient.</li>
	
	</ul>


	<strong>Why create an application only to estimate and
assessment anthropometric measurements?</strong>
	<ul>
	  <li>First because there are several estimating equations proposed 
by different authors and different life stages (adult, older, child 
with cerebral palsy and etc) and I do not know if an application 
stand estimate the weight, height and power needs. This 
should be examined by specialist applications;</li>
	  <li>Second because a mobile application to enable mobile
professionals to greater agility, considering that the number of 
users of smartphones has grown increasingly in the world 
associated with low cost applications compared to software 
and increases  the potential scope of tool.</li>
	
	</ul>


<strong>The target audience</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Dietitian in the world especially those present in clinics,
hospitals and home care - if the tool is available in at least two 
languages;</li>
	<li>Graduate and Post-Graduate students in the world - if the tool 
is available in at least two languages;</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>Note:</strong> All applications for calculating estimates of weight, height and
etcetera are based on the same principle. There are 
mathematical equations proposed by various authors and 
what's different are the variables used by each author and the 
values ?contained in the formulas, so I presented just one 
example.</div>
