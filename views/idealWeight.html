FORMULA 1: IDEAL WEIGHT (BROCA INDEX)
Ideal weight  (kg):
= current height – 100 cm
Broca, 1871
EXAMPLE 1: IDEAL WEIGHT (BROCA INDEX)
Ideal weight  (kg):
Example: If height is 173 cm
= current height – 100 cm
= 173 – 100 
= 73kg = ideal weight
FORMULA 2: ADJUSTED WEIGHT TO OVER WEIGHT AND UNDER WEIGHT
 If    BMI < 18,5kg/m² and BMI > 30kg/m²
= (current weight – ideal weight) x 0,25 + ideal weight
Kushner, 1993
EXAMPLE 2: ADJUSTED WEIGHT TO OBESE
Adjusted weight to obese (kg): if BMI > 30kg/m²
= (current weight – ideal weight) x 0,25 + ideal weight
  Example: weight current = 100 kg                      ideal weight = 73 kg Adjusted weight = (100 – 73) x 0,25 + 73                                         6,75 + 73                                           79,75 kg = adjusted weight
FORMULA 3: ADJUSTED WEIGHT TO MALNUTRITION
Adjusted weight to malnutrition (kg):     If BMI < 18kg/m²
= (ideal weight – current weight) x 0,25 + ideal current
Kushner, 1993
EXAMPLE 3: ADJUSTED WEIGHT TO MALNUTRITION
Adjusted weight to malnutrition (kg): if BMI < 18kg/m²
= (ideal weight – current weight) x 0,25 + ideal current ideal  weight = 54 kg Current weight = 40 kg
= (54-40) x 0,25 + 54 = 57,5 kg (adjusted weight to malnutrition)
